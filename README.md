## Flow of the Application

### **1. Audio to Text Conversion**
- The user speaks, and their voice input is recorded.
- The recorded audio file is sent to Groq's API for transcription.
- **Model Used:** `distil-whisper-large-v3-en`
- **API Call:**
  ```python
  transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
      file=(audio_file_path, file.read()),
      model="distil-whisper-large-v3-en",
      response_format="verbose_json",
  )
  ```
- The API returns a **detailed JSON response** containing the transcribed text.

### **2. Processing with LLM**
- The transcribed text is sent to Groq's LLM for generating a response.
- **Model Used:** `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`
- **API Key** is required for authentication.
- The LLM processes the input and generates a meaningful response.

### **3. Text to Speech Conversion**
- The generated text response is converted into speech using **Kokoro 82M** (a locally running TTS model).
- **Pipeline:**
  ```python
  audio_file = text_to_speech(full_response)
  ```
- The generated speech is played back to the user.

### **4. Complete Voice Chat Bot Experience**
- The application integrates **speech-to-text, LLM processing, and text-to-speech** to create a full **voice-based chatbot**.
- Users can **speak to the bot, receive AI-generated responses, and hear the responses spoken back to them**.
